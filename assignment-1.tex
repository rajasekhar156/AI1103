QUESTION:\\
A manufacturer has three machine operators A, B and C. The first operator A produces 1$\%$ defective items, where as the other two operators B and C produce 5$\%$ and 7$\%$ defective items respectively. A is on the job
for 50$\%$ of the time, B is on the job for 30$\%$ of the time and C is on the job for 20$\%$ of the time. A defective item is produced, what
is the probability that it was produced by A$?$
\\ \\
ANSWER:\\
Let X $\in\{0,1,2\}$ be the random variable denoting that item was produced by operator A when X$=$0, and random variable Y $\in\{0,1\}$ be the random variable deoting that item produced was  defective when Y$=$1.\\ \\
	P(X$=$0) $=\frac{50}{100} =$ 0.5 \\ \\
    P(X$=$1) $=\frac{30}{100} =$ 0.3 \\ \\ 
    P(X$=$2) $=\frac{20}{100} =$ 0.2 \\ \\	
	P(Y$=$1/X$=$0) $=$ 0.01\\ \\
	P(Y$=$1/X$=$1) $=$ 0.05\\ \\
	P(Y$=$1/X$=$2) $=$ 0.07\\ \\
	From conditional probability we say that \\ \\
	P(X$=$0/Y$=$1) $=$ $\frac{P(Y=1/X=0)P(X=0)}{\sum_{i=0}^{i=2}P(Y=1/X=i)P(X=i)}$\\ \\ 
	P(X$=$0/Y$=$1) $=$ $\frac{(0.01)(0.5)}{(0.01)(0.5)+(0.05)(0.3)+(0.07)(0.2)}$ $=$ $\frac{5}{34}$ $=$ 0.147058\\ \\
	Probability that defective item is produced by operator A is 0.147058
