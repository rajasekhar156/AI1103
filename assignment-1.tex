QUESTION:\\
A manufacturer has three machine operators A, B and C. The first operator A produces 1$\%$ defective items, where as the other two operators B and C produce 5$\%$ and 7$\%$ defective items respectively. A is on the job
for 50$\%$ of the time, B is on the job for 30$\%$ of the time and C is on the job for 20$\%$ of the time. A defective item is produced, what
is the probability that it was produced by A$?$
\\ \\
ANSWER:\\
P(A) : be the probability that item is produced by operator A.\\
P(B) : be the probability that item is produced by operator B.\\
P(C) : be the probability that item is produced by operator C.\\
D be the event that item produced is defective.\\ 
So from question it is clear that\\
P(A) $= \frac{50}{100}$ $=$ $\frac{1}{2}$,  P(B) $=$ $\frac{30}{100}$ $=$ $\frac{3}{10}$,  P(C) $=$ $\frac{20}{100}$ $=$ $\frac{1}{5}$.
And-----------(1)\\ \\
P($\frac{D}{A}$) : is the probability of defective item produced by A.\\
P($\frac{D}{B}$) : is the probability of defective item produced by B.\\
P($\frac{D}{C}$) : is the probability of defective item produced by C.\\ 
From the question it is clear that\\
P($\frac{D}{A}$) $=$ $\frac{1}{100}$,  P($\frac{D}{B}$) $=$ $\frac{5}{100}$,  P($\frac{D}{C}$) $=$ $\frac{7}{100}$ -----------(2)\\ \\
P(D) $=$ P(A)P($\frac{D}{A}$) $+$ P(B)P($\frac{D}{B}$) $+$  P(C)P($\frac{D}{C}$)  As the defective item can be produced from either operator A or B or C.\\
P(D) $=$ ($\frac{1}{2}$)($\frac{1}{100}$) $+$ ($\frac{3}{10}$)($\frac{5}{100}$) $+$ ($\frac{1}{5}$)($\frac{7}{100}$) $=$ $\frac{34}{1000}$ \\ \\
We need to find probability that item was produced by operator A given that item is defective P($\frac{A}{D}$)\\
From conditional probability, \\
P($\frac{A}{D}$) $=$ $\frac{P(AD)}{P(D)}$ $=$ 
$\frac{\frac{P(AD)}{P(A)}}{\frac{P(D)}{P(A)}}$ $=$ $\frac{P(\frac{D}{A})}{\frac{P(D)}{P(A)}}$ $=$
$\frac{P(\frac{D}{A})P(A)}{P(D)}$ \\ \\
On substituting values from (1) and (2) \\
P($\frac{A}{D}$) $=$ $\frac{(0.01)(0.5)}{(0.034)}$ $=$ $\frac{5}{34}$\\ 
Required probability is 0.147058
